**Manage your dependency**
---

# What?
Depedia is an open source tool to track/manage your dependency, we follow each dependency in your project and you will register an API to call when each dependency has a new version.  
This tool also tracks project parts, if project has many components each component has its own container and these parts are related to each other, this tool can track this type of dependency.
